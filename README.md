Graphic simulation of entry and exit access control of the laboratories of the BUAP computer science faculty. The number of people (students, teachers) who can enter the laboratory area is taken into account. Each laboratory has a disposable income of 40 people, including students, teachers and collaborators. There are 4 laboratories and 3 exits. At the entrance on San Claudio Avenue there is an entrance access in one door and an exit in another, on building Q there is only one door with an entrance and exit, in addition at the exit to the basement there is only one type of access (exit or entrance). There is only a total capacity of 40% for each space, including the hallway, which can contain a limited number of people waiting to enter or leave the laboratories.
